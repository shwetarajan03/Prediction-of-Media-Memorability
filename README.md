# Prediction_of_Media-Memorability
Neural networks and Deep Learning models are used to predict the memorability of videos. CNN, MLP and RNN are used as part of this work.

#Code Implementation 
The implementation is done in Google Colab.

#Output 
Step 1 : Change the path for os.chdir if needed, as of now it's in : os.chdir("/content/drive/My Drive/Media-Memorability/")
Step 2 : Run the code cells one by one in the memorability.ipynb file for preprocessing and training the models.
Step 3 : After training a model, run the prediction cells at the end of notebook and then run the corresponding code cell for result.
Step 4 : Repeat step 3 for each model.
